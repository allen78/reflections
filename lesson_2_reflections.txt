1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

we transform a directory into repository.
so we can record the history of it.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

staging area contains only files that you want,
instead of all files in the directory.
so you don't have to commit all files in the directory everytime.
