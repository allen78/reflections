1. How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

We can quickly find the lines that we made changes.

2. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

We can easily see what changes we made during a long time

3. What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

manually cossing when to create commits provides more flexibility.
however peoplr make mistakes.

automatically create commits is convenient, however it may not work the way we want.

4. Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

because some files in Git are highly relative,
while most document in Google Docs works independently.

5. How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

first use git log to find the two files you want to compare,
then use git diff to find the differences between them.

6.How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

because we know that if we break something, 
we can always get back to the commit that works fine.

7. Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
