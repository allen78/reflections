1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I am using more than one computer for a project,
ore when there are more than one person working on this project

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

No idea.

3.What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

extra copy

4.How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

to collaborate without using Git and GitHub.
If we are doing a small project,
it might be easier since we can skip many process.
However if we are working on a big project.
it might be difficult to work without Git.

5.When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

I would prefer making changes in a separate branch when
I am developing a new feature which might takes a long time.
It's pretty straight forward to make changes directly in master
branch, but when the features and collaborator grows larger.
Things would go very complicate without using extra branches.
